<h1>FindBugs&trade; Fact Sheet</h1>

<p> FindBugs looks for bugs in Java programs.&nbsp; It is based
on the concept of <i>bug patterns</i>.&nbsp; A bug pattern is a code
idiom that is often an error.&nbsp; Bug patterns arise for a variety
of reasons:

<ul>
<li> Difficult language features
<li> Misunderstood API methods
<li> Misunderstood invariants when code is modified during maintenance
<li> Garden variety mistakes: typos, use of the wrong boolean operator
</ul>

<p> FindBugs uses <i>static analysis</i> to inspect Java bytecode
for occurrences of bug patterns.&nbsp; We have found that FindBugs finds
real errors in most Java software.&nbsp; Because its analysis is
sometimes imprecise, FindBugs can report <i>false warnings</i>,
which are warnings that do not indicate real errors.&nbsp; 
In practice, the rate of false warnings reported by FindBugs
is generally less than 50%.

<p> FindBugs is free software, available under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">Lesser GNU Public License</a>.&nbsp;
It is written in Java, and can be run with any virtual machine compatible
with Sun's JDK 1.4.&nbsp; It can analyze programs written for any version
of Java.&nbsp; FindBugs was originally developed by Bill Pugh.&nbsp;
It is maintained by Bill Pugh, David Hovemeyer, and
a <a href="team.html">team of volunteers</a>.

<p> FindBugs uses <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/">BCEL</a> to
analyze Java bytecode.&nbsp; It uses <a href="http://dom4j.org/">dom4j</a>
for XML manipulation.
