<h1>Contributing to FindBugs</h1>

<p> If you have a bug fix or feature enhancement you would like to contribute,
we would be happy to consider it for inclusion.</p>

<h2>Import FindBugs code as Eclipse projects</h2>

<p>The preferred way to get the FindBugs source code and create the patch is to use Eclipse + Git.
You can easily import FindBugs code into Eclipse by following the steps described
here: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/findbugs/source/browse/eclipsePlugin/doc/building_findbugsplugin.txt">Import Eclipse projects</a>
.
</p>

<h2>Preparing a patch</h2>

<p> The best way to create a patch is to clone FindBugs Git repository here:
 <a href="http://code.google.com/p/findbugs/source/clones">http://code.google.com/p/findbugs/source/clones</a>,
 commit changes with descriptive commit messages (small commits are better) and
 create a new <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/findbugs/patches/">patch ticket</a>
 with the link to your repository.
</p>

<p> Please follow these guidelines when preparing your patch:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Use the same indentation style as the source file(s) you
     are modifying</b>. In particular, please use spaces
     to indent your code; four spaces per indent level.
<li> If at all possible, avoid making whitespace modifications.
<li> Small patches/changesets are appreciated.
<li> If you are submitting a new bug detector, please submit a small
     standalone source file that contains an instance of the
     kind of bug the detector looks for.
</ul>

<p> Following these guidelines makes it much easier for us
to incorporate new code.

<h2>How to submit a patch</h2>

<p> Patches may be submitted through the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/findbugs/patches/">Patches</a> tracker on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/findbugs/">sourceforge project page</a>.
