<h1>FindBugs Changes</h1>

<p> Changes since version 0.7.1:

<ul>
<li> Incorporated patched version of BCEL, which allows classes compiled
     with JDK 1.5.0 beta to be analyzed
<li> Fixed some bugs related to lookups of array classes
<li> Fixed bug that prevented GUI from loading XML result files
     when running under JDK 1.5.0 beta
<li> Added new experimental bug detector, LazyInit, which looks for potentially buggy
     lazy initializations of static fields
<li> Because of long filenames, switched to distributing the source archive
     as a zip file rather than a tar file
<li> The 0.7.1 source tarfile was botched - 0.7.2 has a valid
     source archive
<li> Fixed some problems in the Ant build script
<li> Fixed NullPointerException when checking Class-Path attribute for
     Jar files without manifests
<li> Generate version numbers for the core and UI Eclipse plugins
     using the Version class; all version numbers are now in a common
     location
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.7.0:

<ul>
<li> Eclipse plugin (contributed by Peter Friese)
<li> Source package structure rearranged: all source
     (other than Eclipse plugin UI) is in
     the edu.umd.cs.findbugs package, or a subpackage
<li> Class-Path attributes of manifests of analyzed jar files are
     used to set the aux classpath automatically (Peter D. Stout)
<li> GUI starts in directory specified by user.home property (Peter D. Stout)
<li> Added -project option to GUI (Mikko T.)
<li> Added -look:{plastic,gtk,native} option to GUI, for setting
     look and feel (Mikko T.)
<li> Fixed DataflowAnalysisException in inconsistent synchronization detector
<li> Ant task supports failOnError parameter (Rohan Lloyd)
<li> Serializable class warnings are downgraded to low priority for
     GUI classes
<li> MWN detector will only report calls to wait(), notify(),
     and notifyAll() methods that have the correct signature
<li> FindBugs works with latest CVS version of BCEL
<li> Zip and Jar files may be added to the source path
<li> The GUI will automatically find source files residing in
     analyzed Zip or Jar files
</ul>

<p> Note that the version number jumped from 0.6.6 to 0.6.9;
there were no 0.6.7 or 0.6.8 releases.

<p> Changes since version 0.6.9:
<ul>
<li> Added -conserveSpace option to reduce memory use
     at the expense of analysis precision
<li> Bug fixes in findbugs.bat script: JAVA_HOME handling,
     autodetection of FINDBUGS_HOME, missing output with -textui

</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.6.6:

<ul>
<li> The null pointer dereference detector is more powerful
<li> Significantly improved heuristics and bug fixes in
     inconsistent synchronization detector
<li> Improved heuristics in open stream and dropped exception detectors;
     fewer false positives should be reported
<li> Save HTML summary in XML results files, rather than recomputing;
     this makes loading results in GUI much faster
<li> Report at most one String comparison using == or != per method
<li> The findbugs.bat script on Windows autodetects FINDBUGS_HOME,
     and doesn't open a DOS window when launching the GUI
     (contributed by TJSB)
<li> Emacs reporting format (contributed by David Li)
<li> Various bug fixes
</ul>

<p> Changes since 0.6.5:

<ul>
<li> Rewritten inconsistent synchronization detector;
     accuracy is significantly improved, and bug reports are
     prioritized
<li> New detector to find self assignment (x=x) of local variables
     (suggested by Jeff Martin)
<li> New detector to find calls to wait(), notify(), and notifyAll()
     on an object which is not obviously locked
<li> Open stream detector now reports Readers and Writers
<li> Fixed bug in finalizer idioms detector which caused spurious warnings about
     failure to call super.finalize() (reported by Jim Menard)
<li> Fixed bug where output stream was not closed using non-XML output
     (reported by Sigiswald Madou)
<li> Fixed corrupted HTML bug detail message (reported by Trevor Harmon)
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.6.4:

<ul>
<li> For redundant comparison of reference values, fixed false positives 
     resulting from duplication of code in finally blocks
<li> Fixed false positives resulting from wrapped byte array streams left open
<li> Fixed bug in Ant task preventing output file from working properly
     if a relative path was used

<li> GUI has a summary window, for statistics about overall bug densities
     (contributed by Mike Fagan)
<li> Find redundant comparisons of reference values
<li> More accurate detection of Strings compared with == and != operators
<li> Detection of other reference types which should generally not be compared
     with == and != operators; Boolean, Integer, etc.
<li> Find non-transient non-serializable instance fields in Serializable classes
<li> Source code may be compiled with latest early access generics-enabled javac (version 2.2)
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.6.2:

<ul>
<li> GUI supports filtering bugs by priority
<li> Ant task rewritten; supports all functionality offered by Text UI
     (contributed by Mike Fagan)
<li> Ant task is fully documented in the manual
<li> Classes in nested archives are analyzed; this allows full support for
     analyzing .ear and .war files (contributed by Mike Fagan)
<li> DepthFirstSearch changed to use non-recursive implementation;
     this should fix the StackOverflowErrors that several users
     reported
<li> Various minor bugfixes and improvements
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.6.1:

<ul>
<li> New detector to look for useless control flow (suggested by
     Richard P. King and Mike Fagan)
<li> Look for places where return value of java.io.File.createNewFile()
     is ignored (suggested by Richard P. King)
<li> Fixed bug in resolution of source files (only the first
     source directory was searched)
<li> Fixed a NullPointerException in the bytecode pattern matching code
<li> Ant task supports project files (contributed by Mike Fagan)
<li> Unix findbugs script honors the <code>JAVA_HOME</code>
     environment variable (contributed by Pedro Morais)
<li> Allow .war and .ear files to be analyzed
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.6.0:

<ul>
<li> New bug pattern detector which looks for places where a
     null pointer might be dereferenced
<li> New bug pattern detector which looks for IO streams that are opened,
     do not escape the method, and are not closed on all paths out of the method
<li> New bug pattern detector to find methods that can return null instead
     of a zero-length array
<li> New bug pattern detector to find places where the == or != operators
     are used to compare String objects
<li> Command line interface can save bugs as XML
<li> GUI can save bugs to and load bugs from XML
<li> An "Annotations" window in the GUI allows the user to add
     textual annotations to bug reports; these annotations are preserved
     when bugs are saved as XML
<li> In this release, the Japanese bug summary translations by
     Germano Leichsenring are really included (they were inadvertently
     omitted in the previous release)
<li> Completely rewrote the control flow graph builder, hopefully
     for the last time
<li> Simplified implementation of control flow graphs, which should reduce
     memory use and possibly improve performance
<li> Improvements to command line interface (list bug priorities, filter by priority,
     specify aux classpath, specify project to analyze)
<li> Various bug fixes and enhancements
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.5.4

<ul>
<li> Added an <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> task for FindBugs,
     contributed by Mike Fagan.
<li> Added a GUI dialog which allows individual bug pattern detectors
     to be enabled or disabled.&nbsp; Disabling certain slow detectors
     can greatly speed up analysis of large programs, at the expense of
     reducing the number of potential bugs found.
<li> Added a new detector for finding improperly ignored return values for
     methods such as <code>String.trim()</code>.&nbsp; Suggested
     by Andreas Mandel.
<li> Japanese translations of the bug summaries, contributed by Germano Leichsenring.
<li> Filtering of results is supported in command line interface.
     See the <a href="manual/index.html">FindBugs manual</a> for details.
<li> Added "byte code patterns", a general pattern matching infrastructure
     for bytecode instructions.&nbsp; This feature significantly reduces
     the complexity of implementing new bug pattern detectors.
<li> Enabled a new general dataflow analysis to track values in methods.
<li> Switched to new control-flow graph builder implementation.
</ul>

<p>Changes since version 0.5.3

<ul>
<li> Fixed a bug in the script used to launch FindBugs on Windows platforms.
<li> Fixed crashes when analyzing class files without source line information.
<li> All major errors are reported using an error dialog; file not found errors
     are more informative.
<li> Minor GUI improvements.
</ul>

<p>Changes since version 0.5.2

<ul>
<li> All of the source code and related files are in a single directory tree.
<li> Updated some of the detectors to produce source line information.
<li> <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> build script and several
     GUI enhancements and fixes contributed by Mike Fagan.
<li> Converted to use a <a href="AddingDetectors.txt">plugin architecture</a> for
     loading bug detectors.
<li> Eliminated generics-related compiler warnings.
<li> More complete documentation has been added.
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.5.1:
<ul>
<li> Fixed a large number of bugs in the BCEL Repository and FindBugs's use
     of the Repository.&nbsp; With these changes, FindBugs should <em>never</em>
     crash or otherwise misbehave because of Repository lookup failures.&nbsp;
     Because of these changes, you must use a modified version of <code>bcel.jar</code>
     with FindBugs.&nbsp; This jar file is included in the FindBugs 0.5.2
     binary release.&nbsp; A complete patch containing the 
     <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/bugs/bcel-30-April-2003.patch"
     >modifications against the BCEL CVS main branch as of April 30, 2003</a>
     is also available.
<li> Implemented the "auxiliary classpath entry list".&nbsp; Aux classpath entries
     can be added to a project to provide classes that are referenced by the
     analyzed application, but should not themselves be analyzed.&nbsp; Having
     all referenced classes available allows FindBugs to produce more
     accurate results.
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.5.0:
<ul>
<li> Many user interface bugs have been fixed.
<li> Upgraded to a recent CVS version of BCEL, with some bug fixes.&nbsp;
This should prevent FindBugs from crashing when there is a failure to find
a class on the classpath.
<li> Added support for Plastic look and feel from <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/">jgoodies.com</a>.
<li> Major overhaul of infrastructure for doing dataflow analysis.
</ul>
