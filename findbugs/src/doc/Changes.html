     use of accessors for visited class features (Brian Goetz)
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.7.3:

     to look for non-escaping JDBC resources
     (connections and statements) that aren't
     closed on all paths out of method
<li> Eclipse plugin fixed so it compiles and runs on Eclipse 2.1.x
     (Peter Friese)

     description in a view (Phil Crosby)
<li> Various tweaks to existing detectors to reduce false warnings
<li> New command line option <code>-workHard</code> enables pruning

     of a 30%-100% slowdown
<li> New website and HTML documentation design
<li> Documentation includes an HTML document with descriptions of
     all bug patterns reported by FindBugs
<li> Web page has a link to a
     <a href="http://www.simeji.com/findbugs/doc/manual_ja/index.html">Japanese translation</a>
     of the FindBugs manual, contributed by Hiroshi Okugawa
<li> Changed the Inconsistent Synchronization detector so that fields
     synchronized 50% of the time (or more) are reported as
     medium priority bugs (previously they were reported as low)
<li> New detector to find code that catches IllegalMonitorStateException
<li> New detector to find private methods that are never called
<li> New detector to find suspicious uses of non-short-circuiting boolean
     operators (<code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>, rather than
     <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>)
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.7.1:

<li> Fixed some problems in the Ant build script
<li> Fixed NullPointerException when checking Class-Path attribute for
     Jar files without manifests
<li> Generate version numbers for the core and UI Eclipse plugins

     location
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.7.0:

<ul>

<li> Various bug fixes
</ul>

<p> Changes since 0.6.5:

<ul>
<li> Rewritten inconsistent synchronization detector;
     accuracy is significantly improved, and bug reports are
     prioritized
<li> New detector to find self assignment (x=x) of local variables

     Germano Leichsenring are really included (they were inadvertently
     omitted in the previous release)
<li> Completely rewrote the control flow graph builder, hopefully
     for the last time
<li> Simplified implementation of control flow graphs, which should reduce
     memory use and possibly improve performance
<li> Improvements to command line interface (list bug priorities, filter by priority,
     specify aux classpath, specify project to analyze)
<li> Various bug fixes and enhancements
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.5.4

<ul>
<li> Added an <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> task for FindBugs,
     contributed by Mike Fagan.
<li> Added a GUI dialog which allows individual bug pattern detectors
     to be enabled or disabled.&nbsp; Disabling certain slow detectors
     can greatly speed up analysis of large programs, at the expense of
     reducing the number of potential bugs found.
<li> Added a new detector for finding improperly ignored return values for
     methods such as <code>String.trim()</code>.&nbsp; Suggested
     by Andreas Mandel.
<li> Japanese translations of the bug summaries, contributed by Germano Leichsenring.
<li> Filtering of results is supported in command line interface.
     See the <a href="manual/index.html">FindBugs manual</a> for details.
<li> Added "byte code patterns", a general pattern matching infrastructure
     for bytecode instructions.&nbsp; This feature significantly reduces
     the complexity of implementing new bug pattern detectors.
<li> Enabled a new general dataflow analysis to track values in methods.
<li> Switched to new control-flow graph builder implementation.
</ul>

<p>Changes since version 0.5.3

<ul>
<li> Fixed a bug in the script used to launch FindBugs on Windows platforms.
<li> Fixed crashes when analyzing class files without source line information.
<li> All major errors are reported using an error dialog; file not found errors
     are more informative.
<li> Minor GUI improvements.
</ul>

<p>Changes since version 0.5.2

<ul>
<li> All of the source code and related files are in a single directory tree.
<li> Updated some of the detectors to produce source line information.
<li> <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> build script and several
     GUI enhancements and fixes contributed by Mike Fagan.
<li> Converted to use a <a href="AddingDetectors.txt">plugin architecture</a> for
     loading bug detectors.
<li> Eliminated generics-related compiler warnings.
<li> More complete documentation has been added.
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.5.1:
<ul>
<li> Fixed a large number of bugs in the BCEL Repository and FindBugs's use
     of the Repository.&nbsp; With these changes, FindBugs should <em>never</em>
     crash or otherwise misbehave because of Repository lookup failures.&nbsp;
     Because of these changes, you must use a modified version of <code>bcel.jar</code>
     with FindBugs.&nbsp; This jar file is included in the FindBugs 0.5.2
     binary release.&nbsp; A complete patch containing the 
     <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/bugs/bcel-30-April-2003.patch"
     >modifications against the BCEL CVS main branch as of April 30, 2003</a>
     is also available.
<li> Implemented the "auxiliary classpath entry list".&nbsp; Aux classpath entries
     can be added to a project to provide classes that are referenced by the
     analyzed application, but should not themselves be analyzed.&nbsp; Having
     all referenced classes available allows FindBugs to produce more
     accurate results.
</ul>

<p> Changes since version 0.5.0:
<ul>
<li> Many user interface bugs have been fixed.
<li> Upgraded to a recent CVS version of BCEL, with some bug fixes.&nbsp;
This should prevent FindBugs from crashing when there is a failure to find
a class on the classpath.
<li> Added support for Plastic look and feel from <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/">jgoodies.com</a>.
<li> Major overhaul of infrastructure for doing dataflow analysis.
</ul>
