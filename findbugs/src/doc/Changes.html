						FindBugs Change Log, Version 1.2.0
					</h1>

					<p> Changes since version 1.1.3</p>
					<ul>
					<li>In null pointer analysis, try to be better about always showing two locations: where it is known null and
					where it is dereferenced.
					<li>Interprocedural analysis of which methods return nonnull values
					<li>Use method calls to select order in which classes are analyzed, and order in which methods
					are analyzed, to improve interprocedural analysis results.
					<li>Significant improvements in memory footprint, memory allocation and CPU utilization 
					    (20-30% reduction in all three) 
					<li>Added a project name, to provide better descriptions in the HTML output.
					<li>Added new bug pattern: Casting to char, or bit masking with nonnegative value, and then checking to see
						if the result is negative.
					<li>Stopped reporting transient fields
					of classes not marked as serializable. Transient is used by other persistence frameworks.
					<li>Improvements to detector for SQL injection (Thanks to Matt Hargett for
					his contributions
					<li>Changed open/save options in GUI2 to not distinguish between FindBugs projects
					and saved FindBugs analysis results.
					<li>Improvements to detection of serious non-short-circuit evaluation.
					<li>Updated Japanese localization (thanks to Ruimo Uno)
					
					<li>Eclipse plugin changes:
					<ul>
					<li>Created Bug User Annotations and Bug Tree Views
					<li>Use different icons for different bug priorities
					<li>Provide more information in Bug Details view
					</ul>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						Changes since version 1.1.2:
					</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Fixed broken Ant task
					<li>Added running ant task to smoketest
					<li>Added validating xml and html output to smoketest
					<li>Fixed some  (but not all) issues with html output validation
					<li>Added check for x.equals(x) and x.compareTo(x)
					<li>Various bug fixes
					</ul>
					<p>
						Changes since version 1.1.1:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Added check for infinite iterative loops
						</li>
						<li>
							Added check for use of incompatible types in a collection (e.g.,
							checking to see if a Set&lt;String&gt; contains a StringBuffer).
						</li>
						<li>
							Added check for invocations of equals or hashCode on a URL,
							which,
							<a
								href="http://michaelscharf.blogspot.com/2006/11/javaneturlequals-and-hashcode-make.html">surprising
								many people</a>, requires DNS resolution.
						</li>
						<li>
							Added check for classes that define compareTo but not equals;
							such classes can exhibit some anomalous behavior (e.g., they are
							treated differently by PriorityQueues in Java 5 and Java 6).
						</li>
						<li>
							Added a check for useless self operations (e.g., x < x or x ^ x).
						</li>
						<li>
							Fixed a datarace that could cause the GUI to fail on startup
						</li>
						<li>
							Partial internationalization of the new GUI
						</li>
						<li>
							Fix bug in "Redo analysis" option of new GUI
						</li>
						<li>
							Tuning to reduce false positives
						</li>
						<li>
							Fixed a bug in null pointer analysis that was generating false
							positive null pointer warnings on exception paths. Fixing this
							bug eliminates about 1/4 of the warnings on null pointer
							exceptions on exception paths.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fixed a bug in the processing of phi nodes for fields in the null
							pointer analysis
						</li>
						<li>
							Applied contributed patch that provides more quick fixes in
							Eclipse plugin.
						</li>
						<li>
						Fixed a number of bugs in the Eclipse auto update sites, and in the way
						date qualifiers were being used in the Eclipse plugin. You may need to manually
						disable your existing version of the plugin and download the 1.1.2 from the update 
						site to get the automatic update function working correctly.
						The Eclipse update sites are described at <a href="http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/eclipse/">http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/eclipse/</a>.
						
						</li>
						<li>
							Fixed progress bar in Eclipse plugin
						</li>
						<li>
							A number of other bug fixes.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Changes since version 1.1.0:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							less scanning of classes not on the analysis path (This was
							causing some performance problems.)
						</li>
						<li>
							no unread field warnings for fields annotated with
							javax.persistent or javax.ejb3
						</li>
						<li>
							Eclipse plugin
							<ul>
								<li>
									bug annotation info displayed in Bug Details tab
								</li>
								<li>
									.fbwarnings data file now stored in .metadata (not in the
									project itself)
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							new SE_BAD_FIELD_INNER_CLASS pattern
						</li>
						<li>
							updates to Japanese translation (ruimo)
						</li>
						<li>
							fix some internal slashed/dotted path confusion
						</li>
						<li>
							other minor improvements
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Changes since version 1.0.0:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Overall, the change from FindBugs 1.0.0 to FindBugs 1.1.0 has
							been a big change. We've done a lot of work in a lot of areas,
							and aren't even going to try to enumerate all the changes.
						</li>
						<li>
							We spent a lot of time reviewing the results generated by
							FindBugs for open source and commercial code bases, and made a
							number of changes, small and large, to minimize the number of
							false positives. Our primary focus for this was warnings reported
							as high and medium priority correctness warnings. Our internal
							evaluation is that we produce very few high/medium priority
							correctness warnings where the analysis is actually wrong, and
							that more than 75% of the high/medium priority correctness
							warnings correspond to real coding defects that need addressing
							in the source code. The remaining 25% are largely cases such as a
							branch or statement that if taken would lead to an error, but in
							fact is a dead branch or statement that can never be taken. Such
							coding is confusing and hard to maintain, so it should arguably
							be fixed, but it is unlikely to actually result in an error
							during execution. Thus, some might classify those warnings as
							false positives.

						</li>
						<li>
							We've substantially improved the analysis for errors that could
							result in null pointer dereferences. Overall, our experience has
							been that these changes have roughly doubled the number of null
							pointer errors we detect, without increasing the number of false
							positives (in fact, our false positive rate has gone down). The
							improvements are due to four factors:
							<ul>
								<li>
									By default, we now do some interprocedural analysis to
									determine methods that unconditionally dereference their
									parameters.
								</li>
								<li>
									FindBugs also comes with a model of which JDK methods
									unconditionally dereference their parameters.
								</li>
								<li>
									We do limited tracking of fields, so that we can detect null
									values stored in fields that lead to exceptions.
								</li>
								<li>
									We implemented a new analysis technique to find guaranteed
									dereferences. Consider the following example:

									<code>
										<pre>public int f(Object x, boolean b) {
  int result = 0;
  if (x == null) result++;
  else result--;
  // at this point, we know x is null on a simple path
  if (b) {
    // at this point, x is only null on a complex path
    // we don't know if the path in which x is null and b is true is feasible
    return result + x.hashCode();
    }
  else {
    // at this point, x is only null on a complex path
    // we don't know if the path in which x is null and b is false is feasible
    return result - x.hashCode();
    }
</pre>
									</code>

									<p>
										FindBugs 1.0 used forward dataflow analysis to determine
										whether each value is definitely null, null on a simple path,
										possible null on a complex path, or definitely nonnull. Thus,
										at the statement where
										<code>
											result
										</code>
										is decremented, we know that
										<code>
											x
										</code>
										is definitely null, and at the point before
										<code>
											if (b)
										</code>
										, we know that
										<code>
											x
										</code>
										is null on a simple path. If
										<code>
											x
										</code>
										were to be dereferenced here, we would generate a warning,
										because if the else branch of the
										<code>
											if (x == null)
										</code>
										were ever taken, a null pointer exception would result.
									</p>

									<p>
										However, in both the then and else branches of the
										<code>
											if (b)
										</code>
										statement,
										<code>
											x
										</code>
										is only null on a complex path that may be infeasible. It
										might be that the program logic is such that if
										<code>
											x
										</code>
										is null, then
										<code>
											b
										</code>
										is never true, so generating a warning about the dereference
										in the then clause might be a false positive. We could try to
										analyze the program to determine whether it is possible for
										<code>
											x
										</code>
										to be null and
										<code>
											b
										</code>
										to be true, but that can be a hard analysis problem.
									</p>

									<p>
										However,
										<code>
											x
										</code>
										is dereferenced in both the then
										<em>and</em> else branches of the
										<code>
											if (b)
										</code>
										statement. So at the point immediately before
										<code>
											if (b)
										</code>
										, we know that
										<code>
											x
										</code>
										is null on a simple path
										<em>and</em> that
										<code>
											x
										</code>
										is guaranteed to be dereferenced on all paths from this point
										forward. FindBugs 1.1 performs a backwards data flow analysis
										to determine the values that are guaranteed to be
										dereferenced, and will generate a warning in this case.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								The following screen shot of our new GUI shows an example of
								this analysis, as well as showing off our new GUI and points out
								a limitation of our current plugins for Eclipse and Netbeans.
								The screen shot shows a null pointer bug in HelpDisplay.java.
								The test for
								<code>
									href!=null
								</code>
								on line 78 suggests that
								<code>
									href
								</code>
								could be null. If it is, then
								<code>
									href
								</code>
								will be dereferenced on either line 87 or on line 90, generating
								a NPE. Note that our analysis here also understands that passing
								<code>
									href
								</code>
								to
								<code>
									URLEncoder.encode
								</code>
								will deference it, and thus treats line 87 as a dereference,
								even though
								<code>
									href
								</code>
								is not actually dereferenced at that line. Within our new GUI,
								all of these locations are highlighted and listed in the summary
								panel. In the original GUI (and in HTML output) we list all of
								the locations, but only the primary location is highlighted by
								the original GUI. In the Eclipse and Netbeans plugins, only the
								primary location is displayed; fixing this is on our todo list
								(contributions welcome).

						</li>
						<li>
							Preliminary support for detectors using the frameworks other than
							BCEL, such as the
							<a href="http://asm.objectweb.org/">ASM</a> bytecode framework.
							You may experiment with writing ASM-based detectors, but beware
							the API may still change (which could possibly also affect
							BCEL-based detectors). In general, we've started trying to move
							away from a deep dependence on BCEL, but that change is only
							partially complete. Probably best to just avoid this until we
							complete more work on this. This change is only visible to
							FindBugs plugin developers, and shouldn't be visible to FindBugs
							users.
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Bug categories (CORRECTNESS, MT_CORRECTNESS, etc.) are no longer
								hard-coded, but rather defined in xml files associated with
								plugins, including the core plugin which defines the standard
								categories. Third-party plugins can define their own categories.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Several bug patterns have been moved from CORRECTNESS and STYLE
								into a new category, BAD_PRACTICE. The English localization of
								STYLE has changed from "Style" to "Dodgy."
							</p>
							<p>
								In general, we've worked very hard to limit CORRECTNESS bugs to
								be real programming errors and sins of commission. We have
								reclassified as BAD_PRACTICE a number of bad design practices
								that result in overly fragile code, such as defining an equals
								method that doesn't accept null or defining class with a equals
								method that inherits hashCode from class Object.
							</p>
							<p>
								In general, our guidelines for deciding whether a bug should be
								classified as CORRECTNESS, BAD_PRACTICE or STYLE are:
							</p>
							<dl>
								<dt>
									CORRECTNESS
								</dt>
								<dd>
									A problem that we can recognize with high confidence and is an
									issue that we believe almost all developers would want to
									examine and address. We recommend that software teams review
									all high and medium priority warnings in their entire code
									base.
								</dd>
								<dt>
									BAD_PRACTICE
								</dt>
								<dd>
									A problem that we can recognize with high confidence and
									represents a clear violation of recommended and standard coding
									practice. We believe each software team should decide which bad
									practices identified by FindBugs it wants to prohibit in the
									team's coding standard, and take action to remedy violations of
									those coding standards.
								</dd>
								<dt>
									STYLE
								</dt>
								<dd>
									These are places where something strange or dodgy is going on,
									such as a dead store to a local variable. Typically, less than
									half of these represent actionable programming defects.
									Reviewing these warnings in any code under active development
									is probably a good idea, but reviewing all such warnings in
									your entire code base might be appropriate only in some
									situations. Individual or team programming styles can
									substantially influence the effectiveness of each of these
									warnings (e.g., you might have a coding practice or style in
									your group that confuses one of the detectors into generating a
									lot of STYLE warnings); you will likely want to selectively
									suppress or report the STYLE warnings that are effective for
									your group.
								</dd>
							</dl>
						</li>
						<li>
							Released a preliminary version of a new GUI (known internally as
							GUI2 -- not very creative, huh?)
						</li>
						<li>
							Provided standard ways to mark user designations of bug warnings
							(e.g., as NOT_A_BUG or SHOULD_FIX). The internal logic now
							records this, it is represented in the XML file, and GUI2 allows
							the designations to be applied (along with free-form user
							annotations about each warning). The user designations and
							annotations are not yet supported by the Eclipse plugin, but we
							clearly want to support it in Eclipse shortly.
						</li>
						<li>
							Added a check for a bad comparison with a signed byte with a
							value not in the range -128..127. For example:
							<code>
								<pre>boolean find200(byte b[]) {
  for(int i = 0; i < b.length; i++) if (b[i] == 200) return i;
  return -1;
}
</pre>
							</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							Added a checking for testing if a value is equal to Double.NaN
							(no value is equal to NaN, not even NaN).
						</li>
						<li>
							Added a check for using a class with an equals method but no
							hashCode method in a hashed data structure.
						</li>
						<li>
							Added check for uncallable method of an anonymous inner class.
							For example, in the following code, it is impossible to invoke
							the initalValue method (because the name is misspelled and as a
							result is doesn't override a method in ThreadLocal).
							<code>
								<pre>private static ThreadLocal serialNum = new ThreadLocal() {
         protected synchronized Object initalValue() {
             return new Integer(nextSerialNum++);
         }
     };
</pre>
							</code>
						</li>
						<li>
							Added check for a dead local store caused by a switch statement
							fallthrough
						</li>
						<li>
							Added check for computing the absolute value of a random 32 bit
							integer or of a hashcode. This is broken because
							<code>
								Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) == Integer.MIN_VALUE
							</code>
							, and thus result of calling Math.abs, which is expected to be
							nonnegative, will in fact be negative one time out of 2
							<sup>
								32
							</sup>
							, which will invariably be the time your boss is demoing the
							software to your customers.

						</li>
						<li>
							More careful resolution of inherited methods and fields. Some of
							the shortcuts we were taking in FindBugs 1.0.0 were leading to
							inaccurate results, and it was fairly easy to address this by
							making the analysis more accurate.
						</li>
						<li>
							Overall, analysis times are about 1.6 times longer in FindBugs
							1.1.0 than in FindBugs 1.0.0. This is because we have enabled
							substantial additional analysis at the default effort level (the
							actual analysis engine is significantly faster than in FindBugs
							1.0). On a recent AMD Athlon processor, analyzing JDK1.6.0 (about
							1 million lines of code) requires about 15 minutes of wall clock
							time.
						</li>
						<li>
							Provided class and script (printClass) to print classfile in the
							human readable format produced by BCEL
						</li>
						<li>
							Provided -findSource option to setBugDatabaseInfo
						</li>
					</ul>

							contributed by Mike Fagan.
						</li>
						<li>
							Added a GUI dialog which allows individual bug pattern detectors
							to be enabled or disabled.&nbsp; Disabling certain slow detectors
							can greatly speed up analysis of large programs, at the expense
							of reducing the number of potential bugs found.
						</li>
						<li>
							Added a new detector for finding improperly ignored return values
							for methods such as
							<code>
								String.trim()
							</code>
							.&nbsp; Suggested by Andreas Mandel.
						</li>
						<li>
							Japanese translations of the bug summaries, contributed by
							Germano Leichsenring.
						</li>
						<li>
							Filtering of results is supported in command line interface. See
							the
							<a href="manual/index.html">FindBugs manual</a> for details.
						</li>
						<li>
							Added "byte code patterns", a general pattern matching
							infrastructure for bytecode instructions.&nbsp; This feature
							significantly reduces the complexity of implementing new bug
							pattern detectors.
						</li>
						<li>
							Enabled a new general dataflow analysis to track values in
							methods.
						</li>
						<li>
							Switched to new control-flow graph builder implementation.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Changes since version 0.5.3

					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Fixed a bug in the script used to launch FindBugs on Windows
							platforms.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fixed crashes when analyzing class files without source line
							information.
						</li>
						<li>
							All major errors are reported using an error dialog; file not
							found errors are more informative.
						</li>
						<li>
							Minor GUI improvements.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Changes since version 0.5.2

					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							All of the source code and related files are in a single
							directory tree.
						</li>
						<li>
							Updated some of the detectors to produce source line information.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> build script and several
							GUI enhancements and fixes contributed by Mike Fagan.
						</li>
						<li>
							Converted to use a
							<a href="AddingDetectors.txt">plugin architecture</a> for loading
							bug detectors.
						</li>
						<li>
							Eliminated generics-related compiler warnings.
						</li>
						<li>
							More complete documentation has been added.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Changes since version 0.5.1:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Fixed a large number of bugs in the BCEL Repository and
							FindBugs's use of the Repository.&nbsp; With these changes,
							FindBugs should
							<em>never</em> crash or otherwise misbehave because of Repository
							lookup failures.&nbsp; Because of these changes, you must use a
							modified version of
							<code>
								bcel.jar
							</code>
							with FindBugs.&nbsp; This jar file is included in the FindBugs
							0.5.2 binary release.&nbsp; A complete patch containing the
							<a
								href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/bugs/bcel-30-April-2003.patch">modifications
								against the BCEL CVS main branch as of April 30, 2003</a> is also
							available.
						</li>
						<li>
							Implemented the "auxiliary classpath entry list".&nbsp; Aux
							classpath entries can be added to a project to provide classes
							that are referenced by the analyzed application, but should not
							themselves be analyzed.&nbsp; Having all referenced classes
							available allows FindBugs to produce more accurate results.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Changes since version 0.5.0:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Many user interface bugs have been fixed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Upgraded to a recent CVS version of BCEL, with some bug
							fixes.&nbsp; This should prevent FindBugs from crashing when
							there is a failure to find a class on the classpath.
						</li>
						<li>
							Added support for Plastic look and feel from
							<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/">jgoodies.com</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Major overhaul of infrastructure for doing dataflow analysis.
						</li>
