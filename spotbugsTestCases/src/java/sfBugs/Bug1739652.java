/**
 * Submitted By: Yvan Norsa Summary:
 * 
 * FindBugs (1.2.1-rc2) finds a DE_MIGHT_IGNORE when compiling with debug info
 * (that is, the default javac options) the following file :
 * 
 * final class A { public void foo() { try { Class.forName("A"); } catch
 * (ClassNotFoundException classEx) { } } }
 * 
 * However, if you put the catch block '}' on the same line as the opening '{',
 * no bug is found.
 * 
 * Furthermore, if you compile with -g:none, the '}' position won't have any
 * influence on the number of bugs found.
 * 
 * I had a look at the class file when compiled with default debug options, and
 * the file size is different, probably because of the line numbers info. But
 * the bytecode obtained with "javap -c" is the same..
