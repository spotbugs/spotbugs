"To get started, right click on a Java project in Package Explorer, and "
"select the option labeled \"Spot Bugs\". SpotBugs will run, and problem "
"markers (displayed in source windows, and also in the Eclipse Problems "
"view) will point to locations in your code which have been identified as "
"potential instances of bug patterns."
msgstr ""

#: ../../eclipse.rst:39
msgid ""
"You can also run SpotBugs on existing java archives (jar, ear, zip, war "
"etc). Simply create an empty Java project and attach archives to the "
"project classpath. Having that, you can now right click the archive node "
"in Package Explorer and select the option labeled \"Spot Bugs\". If you "
"additionally configure the source code locations for the binaries, "
"SpotBugs will also link the generated warnings to the right source files."

"Eclipse plugin supports contribution of custom SpotBugs detectors (see "

"contribute custom plugins to the Eclipse:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../eclipse.rst:58
msgid ""
"Existing standard SpotBugs detector packages can be configured via "
"``Window → Preferences → Java → FindBugs → Misc. Settings → Custom "
"Detectors``. Simply specify there locations of any additional plugin "
"libraries. The benefit of this solution is that already existing detector"
" packages can be used \"as is\", and that you can quickly verify the "
"quality of third party detectors. The drawback is that you have to apply "
"this settings in each new Eclipse workspace, and this settings can't be "
"shared between team members."

"Please check the documentation of the "
"``eclipsePlugin/schema/detectorPlugins.exsd`` extension point how to "
"update the plugin.xml. Existing FindBugs detector plugins can be easily "
"\"extended\" to be full featured SpotBugs AND Eclipse detector plugins. "
"Usually you only need to add ``META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`` and ``plugin.xml`` "
"to the jar and update your build scripts to not to override the "
"``MANIFEST.MF`` during the build."
msgstr ""

#: ../../eclipse.rst:67
msgid ""
"The benefit of this solution is that for given (shared) Eclipse "
"installation each team member has exactly same detectors set, and there "
"is no need to configure anything anymore. The (really small) precondition"
" is that you have to convert your existing detectors package to the valid"
" Eclipse plugin. You can do this even for third-party detector packages. "
"Another major differentiator is the ability to extend the default "
"SpotBugs classpath at runtime with required third party libraries (see "
"AddingDetectors.txt for more information)."
