"Typing defines a standard notation for Python function and variable type "
"annotations. The notation can be used for documenting code in a concise, "
"standard format, and it has been designed to also be used by static and "
"runtime type checkers, static analyzers, IDEs and other tools."

"NOTE: in Python 3.5 and later, the typing module lives in the stdlib, and"
" installing this package has NO EFFECT.  To get a newer version of the "
"typing module in Python 3.5 or later, you have to upgrade to a newer "
"Python (bugfix) version.  For example, typing in Python 3.6.0 is missing "
"the definition of 'Type' -- upgrading to 3.6.2 will fix this."

"Also note that most improvements to the typing module in Python 3.7 will "
"not be included in this package, since Python 3.7 has some built-in "
"support that is not present in older versions (See PEP 560.)"
