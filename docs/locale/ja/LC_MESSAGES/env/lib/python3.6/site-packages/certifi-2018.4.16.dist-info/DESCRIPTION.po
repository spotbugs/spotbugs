"Browsers and certificate authorities have concluded that 1024-bit keys "
"are unacceptably weak for certificates, particularly root certificates. "
"For this reason, Mozilla has removed any weak (i.e. 1024-bit key) "
"certificate from its bundle, replacing it with an equivalent strong (i.e."
" 2048-bit or greater key) certificate from the same CA. Because Mozilla "
"removed these certificates from its bundle, ``certifi`` removed them as "
"well."

"In previous versions, ``certifi`` provided the ``certifi.old_where()`` "
"function to intentionally re-add the 1024-bit roots back into your "
"bundle. This was not recommended in production and therefore was removed."
" To assist in migrating old code, the function ``certifi.old_where()`` "
"continues to exist as an alias of ``certifi.where()``. Please update your"
" code to use ``certifi.where()`` instead. ``certifi.old_where()`` will be"
" removed in 2018."
