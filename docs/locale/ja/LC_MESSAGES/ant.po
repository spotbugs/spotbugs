msgid ""
"This chapter describes how to integrate SpotBugs into a build script for "
"Ant, which is a popular Java build and deployment tool. Using the "
"SpotBugs Ant task, your build script can automatically run SpotBugs on "
"your Java code."

msgid "Installing the Ant task"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ant.rst:12
msgid ""
"To install the Ant task, simply copy ``$SPOTBUGS_HOME/lib/spotbugs-"
"ant.jar`` into the lib subdirectory of your Ant installation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ant.rst:16
msgid ""
"It is strongly recommended that you use the Ant task with the version of "
"SpotBugs it was included with. We do not guarantee that the Ant task Jar "
"file will work with any version of SpotBugs other than the one it was "
"included with."

msgid "Modifying build.xml"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ant.rst:22
msgid ""
"To incorporate SpotBugs into build.xml (the build script for Ant), you "
"first need to add a task definition. This should appear as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../ant.rst:30
msgid ""
"The task definition specifies that when a spotbugs element is seen in "
"``build.xml``, it should use the indicated class to execute the task."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ant.rst:32
msgid ""
"After you have added the task definition, you can define a target which "
"uses the spotbugs task. Here is an example which could be added to the "
"``build.xml`` for the Apache BCEL library."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ant.rst:49
msgid ""
"The spotbugs element must have the home attribute set to the directory in"
" which SpotBugs is installed; in other words, ``$SPOTBUGS_HOME``. See "
":doc:`installing`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ant.rst:51
msgid ""
"This target will execute SpotBugs on ``bcel.jar``, which is the Jar file "
"produced by BCEL's build script. (By making it depend on the \"jar\" "
"target, we ensure that the library is fully compiled before running "
"SpotBugs on it.) The output of SpotBugs will be saved in XML format to a "
"file called ``bcel-sb.xml``. An auxiliary Jar file, Regex.jar, is added "
"to the aux classpath, because it is referenced by the main BCEL library. "
"A source path is specified so that the saved bug data will have accurate "
"references to the BCEL source code."

msgid ""
"Here is an example of invoking Ant from the command line, using the "

msgid ""
"In this case, because we saved the bug results in an XML file, we can use"
