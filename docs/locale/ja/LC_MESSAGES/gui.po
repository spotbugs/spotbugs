"After you have started SpotBugs using the ``spotbugs`` command, choose "
"the ``File → New Project`` menu item. You will see a dialog which looks "

"Use the \"Add\" button next to \"Classpath to analyze\" to select a Java "
"archive file (zip, jar, ear, or war file) or directory containing java "
"classes to analyze for bugs. You may add multiple archives/directories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../gui.rst:16
msgid ""
"You can also add the source directories which contain the source code for"
" the Java archives you are analyzing. This will enable SpotBugs to "
"highlight the source code which contains a possible error. The source "
"directories you add should be the roots of the Java package hierarchy. "
"For example, if your application is contained in the ``org.foobar.myapp``"
" package, you should add the parent directory of the org directory to the"
" source directory list for the project."

"Another optional step is to add additional Jar files or directories as "
"\"Auxiliary classpath locations\" entries. You should do this if the "
"archives and directories you are analyzing have references to other "
"classes which are not included in the analyzed archives/directories and "
"are not in the standard runtime classpath. Some of the bug pattern "
"detectors in FindBugs make use of class hierarchy information, so you "
"will get more accurate results if the entire class hierarchy is available"
" which FindBugs performs its analysis."

"Once you have added all of the archives, directories, and source "
"directories, click the \"Analyze\" button to analyze the classes "
"contained in the Jar files. Note that for a very large program on an "
"older computer, this may take quite a while (tens of minutes). A recent "
"computer with ample memory will typically be able to analyze a large "
"program in only a few minutes."

"When you select a particular bug instance in the top pane, you will see a"
" description of the bug in the \"Details\" tab of the bottom pane. In "
"addition, the source code pane on the upper-right will show the program "
"source code where the potential bug occurs, if source is available. In "
"the above example, the bug is a stream object that is not closed. The "
"source code window highlights the line where the stream object is "
"created."
