"The analysis options have two main purposes. First, they allow you to "
"inform SpotBugs about the meaning of methods in your application, so that"
" it can produce more accurate results, or produce fewer false warnings. "
"Second, they allow you to configure the precision of the analysis "
"performed. Reducing analysis precision can save memory and analysis time,"
" at the expense of missing some real bugs, or producing more false "
"warnings."
