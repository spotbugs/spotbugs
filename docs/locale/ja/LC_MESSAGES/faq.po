"This document contains answers to frequently asked questions about "
"SpotBugs. If you just want general information about SpotBugs, have a "
"look at the manual."

"Q1: I'm getting java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError when I try to run "
"SpotBugs"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:10
msgid ""
"SpotBugs requires JRE8 or later to run. If you use an earlier version, "
"you will see an exception error message similar to the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:13
msgid ""
"Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: "
"edu/umd/cs/findbugs/gui/FindBugsFrame (Unsupported major.minor version "
"52.0)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:16
msgid "The solution is to upgrade to JRE8 or later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:19
msgid "Q2: SpotBugs is running out of memory, or is taking a long time to finish"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:21
msgid ""
"In general, SpotBugs requires lots of memory and a relatively fast CPU. "
"For large applications, 1024M or more of heap space may be required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:24
msgid ""
"By default, SpotBugs allocates 768M of heap space. You can increase this "
"using the ``-maxHeap n`` option, where n is the number of megabytes of "
"heap space to allocate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:28
msgid "Q3: What is the \"auxiliary classpath\"? Why should I specify it?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:30
msgid ""
"Many important facts about a Java class require information about the "
"classes that it references.  For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:32
msgid "What other classes and interfaces the class inherits from"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:33
msgid ""
"What exceptions can be thrown by methods in external classes and "
"interfaces"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:35
msgid ""
"The \"auxiliary classpath\" is a list of Jar files, directories, and "
"class files containing classes that are used by the code you want "
"SpotBugs to analyze, but should not themselves be analyzed by SpotBugs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:37
msgid ""
"If SpotBugs doesn't have complete information about referenced classes, "
"it will not be able to produce results that are as accurate as possible. "
"For example, having a complete repository of referenced classes allows "
"SpotBugs to prune control flow information so it can concentrate on paths"
" through methods that are most likely to be feasible at runtime. Also, "
"some bug detectors (such as the suspicious reference comparison detector)"
" rely on being able to perform type inference, which requires complete "
"type hierarchy information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:41
msgid ""
"For these reasons, we strongly recommend that you completely specify the "
"auxiliary classpath when you run SpotBugs. You can do this by using the "
"``-auxclasspath`` command line option, or the \"Classpath entries\" list "
"in the GUI project editor dialog."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:44
msgid ""
"If SpotBugs cannot find a class referenced by your application, it will "
"print out a message when the analysis completes, specifying the classes "
"that were missing. You should modify the auxiliary classpath to specify "
"how to find the missing classes, and then run SpotBugs again."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:49
msgid "Q4: The Eclipse plugin doesn't load"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:51
msgid ""
"The symptom of this problem is that Eclipse fails to load the SpotBugs UI"
" plugin with the message:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:53
msgid ""
"Plug-in \"edu.umd.cs.findbugs.plugin.eclipse\" was disabled due to "
"missing or disabled prerequisite plug-in \"org.eclipse.ui.ide\""
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:55
msgid ""
"The reason for this problem is that the Eclipse plugin distributed with "
"SpotBugs does not work with older 3.x versions of Eclipse. Please use "
"Eclipse Neon (version 4.6) or newer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:59
msgid "Q5: I'm getting a lot of false \"OS\" and \"ODR\" warnings"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:61
msgid ""
"By default, SpotBugs assumes that any method invocation can throw an "
"unchecked runtime exception. As a result, it may assume that an unchecked"
" exception thrown out of the method could bypass a call to a ``close()`` "
"method for a stream or database resource."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:64
msgid ""
"You can use the ``-workHard`` command line argument or the "
"``findbugs.workHard`` boolean analysis property to make SpotBugs work "
"harder to prune unlikely exception edges. This generally reduces the "
"number of false warnings, at the expense of slowing down the analysis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:68
msgid "Q6: The Eclipse plugin loads, but doesn't work correctly"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:70
msgid ""
"Make sure the Java code you trying to analyze is built properly and has "
"no classpath or compile errors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:71
msgid ""
"Make sure the project and workspace SpotBugs settings are valid - in "
"doubt, revert them to defaults."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:72
msgid "Make sure the Error log view does not show errors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:75
msgid "Q7: Where is the Maven plugin for SpotBugs?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:77
msgid ""
"The Maven Plugin for SpotBugs may be found `here "
"<https://github.com/gleclaire/findbugs-maven-plugin/>`_. Please note that"
" the Maven plugin is not maintained by the SpotBugs developers, so we "
"can't answer questions about it."
