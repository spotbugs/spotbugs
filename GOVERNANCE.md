# Governance Policy

This document provides the governance policy for the SpotBugs Project.

## SpotBugs Core Team

The SpotBugs Core Team maintains the spotbugs/spotbugs GitHub repository.

The GitHub team for SpotBugs Team is `@spotbugs/core-devs`. Members of the SpotBugs Core Team have write access to the repository.

## How we propose changes

Both SpotBugs Core Team and SpotBugs user can propose changes to the SpotBugs project via GitHub pull requests. Refer to `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` to know more detailed requirements for your proposal.

Once a pull request gets two approvals from members of SpotBugs Core Team, pull request can be merged and shipped in the next release.

If pull request cannot get enough approvals during 30 days, it can be labeled as stale pull request. Stale pull requests can be closed after another 30 days.

## Issue Management Policy

Both SpotBugs Core Team and SpotBugs users can create issues at GitHub Issues. Refer to `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` to get more detailed requirements for your proposal.

If issue is not updated for 30 days from when it was labeled as 'need info', SpotBugs Core Team can close it.

## Nomination to the SpotBugs Core Team

Members of SpotBugs Core Team can nominate new members. The nomination process is held at [GitHub Team Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-team-discussions).

We set no clear condition for nomination, but usually nominate from active contributors.
