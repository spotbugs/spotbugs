# SpotBugs

[SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) is the spiritual successor of [FindBugs](https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs), carrying on from the point where it left off with support of its community.


More information at the [official website](https://spotbugs.github.io/). A lot of things can still be found at the [old FindBugs website](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net).
