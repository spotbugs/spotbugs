/**
 * <p>A class representing a location in the CFG for a method. Essentially, it

 * have inlined JSR subroutines, meaning that a single InstructionHandle in a
 * CFG may represent several static locations. To this end, a Location is
 * comprised of both an InstructionHandle and the BasicBlock that contains it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Location objects may be compared with each other using the equals() method,
 * and may be used as keys in tree and hash maps and sets. Note that
 * <em>it is only valid to compare Locations produced from the same CFG</em>.</p>
