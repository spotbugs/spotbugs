### Added
- New simple name-based AnnotationMatcher for exclude files (now bug annotations store the class java annotations in an attribute called `classAnnotationNames`). For example, use like <Match><Annotation name="org.immutables.value.Generated" /></Match> in an excludeFilter.xml to ignore classes generated by the Immutable framework. This ignores all class, method or field bugs in classes with that annotation.
- Added the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) taxonomy to the Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) report. The short and long description for the CWEs are retrived from a JSON file which is a slimmed down version of the official comprehensive CWE XML from MITRE. The JSON contains information about all CWEs. ([#2410](https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2410)).
- New detector `FindAssertionsWithSideEffects` detecting bug `ASSERTION_WITH_SIDE_EFFECT` and `ASSERTION_WITH_SIDE_EFFECT_METHOD` in case of assertions which may have side effects (See [EXP06-J. Expressions used in assertions must not produce side effects](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/EXP06-J.+Expressions+used+in+assertions+must+not+produce+side+effects))
- New rule set `PA_PUBLIC_PRIMITIVE_ATTRIBUTE`, `PA_PUBLIC_ARRAY_ATTRIBUTE` and `PA_PUBLIC_MUTABLE_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTE` to warn for public attributes which are written by the methods of the class. This rule is loosely based on the SEI CERT rule *OBJ01-J Limit accessibility of fields*. ([#OBJ01-J](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/OBJ01-J.+Limit+accessibility+of+fields))
- Extend `SerializableIdiom` detector with new bug type: `SE_PREVENT_EXT_OBJ_OVERWRITE`. It's reported in case of the `readExternal()` method allows any caller to reset any value of an object
- New Detector `FindVulnerableSecurityCheckMethods` for new bug type `VSC_VULNERABLE_SECURITY_CHECK_METHODS`. This bug is reported whenever a non-final and non-private method of a non-final class performs a security check using the `java.lang.SecurityManager`. (See [SEI CERT MET03-J] (https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/MET03-J.+Methods+that+perform+a+security+check+must+be+declared+private+or+final))
- New function added to detector `SynchronizationOnSharedBuiltinConstant`to detect `DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_INTERNED_STRING` ([#2266](https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2266))
- Make TypeQualifierResolver recognize org.apache.avro.reflect.Nullable ([#2066](https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2066))
- New detector `FindArgumentAssertions` detecting bug `ASSERTION_OF_ARGUMENTS` in case of validation of arguments of public functions using assertions (See [MET01-J. Never use assertions to validate method arguments](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/MET01-J.+Never+use+assertions+to+validate+method+arguments))
- Add new detector `CT_CONSTRUCTOR_THROW` for detecting constructors that throw exceptions.
- New detector `DontReusePublicIdentifiers` for new bug type `PI_DO_NOT_REUSE_PUBLIC_IDENTIFIERS`. This bug is reported whenever a new class, interface, field, method or variable is created reusing an identifier from the _Java Standard Library_ . (See [SEI CERT rule DCL01-J](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/DCL01-J.+Do+not+reuse+public+identifiers+from+the+Java+Standard+Library))

### Added
* New detector `ThrowingExceptions` and introduced new bug types:
  * `THROWS_METHOD_THROWS_RUNTIMEEXCEPTION` is reported in case of a method throwing RuntimeException, 
  * `THROWS_METHOD_THROWS_CLAUSE_BASIC_EXCEPTION` is reported when a method has Exception in its throws clause and 
  * `THROWS_METHOD_THROWS_CLAUSE_THROWABLE` is reported when a method has Throwable in its throws clause (See [SEI CERT ERR07-J](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/ERR07-J.+Do+not+throw+RuntimeException%2C+Exception%2C+or+Throwable))
* New rule `PERM_SUPER_NOT_CALLED_IN_GETPERMISSIONS` to warn for custom class loaders who do not call their superclasses' `getPermissions()` in their `getPermissions()` method. This rule based on the SEI CERT rule *SEC07-J Call the superclass's getPermissions() method when writing a custom class loader*. ([#SEC07-J](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/SEC07-J.+Call+the+superclass%27s+getPermissions%28%29+method+when+writing+a+custom+class+loader))
* New rule `USC_POTENTIAL_SECURITY_CHECK_BASED_ON_UNTRUSTED_SOURCE` to detect cases where a non-final method of a non-final class is called from public methods of public classes and then the same method is called on the same object inside a doPrivileged block. Since the called method may have been overridden to behave differently on the first and second invocations this is a possible security check based on an unreliable source. This rule is based on *SEC02-J. Do not base security checks on untrusted sources*. ([#SEC02-J](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/SEC02-J.+Do+not+base+security+checks+on+untrusted+sources))

This detector reports a bug if an instance level lock is used to modify a shared static data. (See [SEI CERT rule LCK06-J](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/LCK06-J.+Do+not+use+an+instance+lock+to+protect+shared+static+data))
