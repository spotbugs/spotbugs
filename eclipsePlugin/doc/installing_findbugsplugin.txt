Here is how to install and use the Find Bugs Eclipse Plug-in:

NOTE: Since FindBugs requires a JDK 1.4.x to run on, you MUST ENSURE that you
start Eclipse using a JRE/JDK 1.4.x (or later) as well.

Install the plug-in
===================================================
1) Extract the contents of the file 
   - edu.umd.cs.findbugs.plugin.eclipse_1.1.0.v20060908.zip
   into the [plugins] folder of your Eclipse installation. This should result in
   the following directory structure:
   <eclipse-dir>
   |
   +- plugins
      |
      +- edu.umd.cs.findbugs.plugin.eclipse_1.1.0.v20060908
         |
         +- plugin.xml
            findbugs.jar
            findbugs-plugin.jar
            annotations.jar
            dom4j-full.jar
            bcel.jar
            asm-3.0.jar
            |
            +- plugin
            |  |
            |  +- coreplugin.jar
            |     Fixes.xml
            |
            +- icons
               |
               +- bug.gif

2) (Re-)start Eclipse


Using the plug-in
==================
The plug-in can operate in two modes: the automatic mode and the manual mode.

Automatic mode
---------------
When running in automatic mode, the plug-in will look for bug patterns every time
you build your project or a single Java file. This means that (normally) every 
time you save a Java file, the FindBugs plug-in will scan this file for bugs.

To enable the automatic mode:
1) Open the context menu of a Java project (please go to the Java perspective first!) 
2) Select [Properties] from the context menu
3) In the properties dialog, switch to the [FindBugs} section and
4) Check the [Run FindBugs automatically] option.
5) Click [OK] or [Apply] to persist your change.

Manual mode
------------
Since running the FindBugs plug-in in automatic mode can be vey time-consuming,
you may choose to run the plug-in in manual mode. As the name implies, you 
have to start the bug pattern detecion manually when the plug-in is in manual mode.

To enable manual mode:
1) Make sure that the [Run FindBugs automatically] checkbox on the Java project properties
   page is disabled.
2) Open the context menu of the current Java project.
3) Select [Find Bugs -> Find Bugs]. The bug pattern detection process will be started.
