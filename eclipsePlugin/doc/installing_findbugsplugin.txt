Here is how to install and use the Find Bugs Eclipse Plug-in:

NOTE: Since FindBugs requires a JDK 1.5.x to run on, you MUST ENSURE that you
start Eclipse using a JRE/JDK 1.5.x (or later) as well.

Install the plug-in
===================================================
1) Extract the contents of the file
   - edu.umd.cs.findbugs.plugin.eclipse_1.1.0.v20060908.zip
   into the [plugins] folder of your Eclipse installation. This should result in
   the following directory structure:
   <eclipse-dir>
   |
   +- plugins
      |
      +- edu.umd.cs.findbugs.plugin.eclipse_1.1.0.v20060908
         |
         +- plugin.xml
            +- icons
            +- lib
            |  |
            |  +- annotations.jar
            |     asm-3.3.jar
            |     asm-commons-3.3.jar
            |     asm-tree-3.3.jar
            |     bcel.jar
            |     commons-lang-2.6.jar
            |     dom4j-2.1.3.jar
            |     jaxen-1.1.6.jar
            |     jsr305.jar
            |
            +- META-INF
            |  |
            |  +- MANIFEST.MF
            |
            +- plugin
            findbugs-plugin.jar
            plugin.properties
            plugin.xml

Using the plug-in
==================
The plug-in can operate in two modes: the automatic mode and the manual mode.

Automatic mode
---------------
When running in automatic mode, the plug-in will look for bug patterns every time
you build your project or a single Java file. This means that (normally) every
time you save a Java file, the FindBugs plug-in will scan this file for bugs.

To enable the automatic mode:
1) Open the context menu of a Java project (please go to the Java perspective first!)
2) Select [Properties] from the context menu
3) In the properties dialog, switch to the [FindBugs} section and
4) Check the [Run FindBugs automatically] option.
5) Click [OK] or [Apply] to persist your change.

Manual mode
------------
Since running the FindBugs plug-in in automatic mode can be vey time-consuming,
you may choose to run the plug-in in manual mode. As the name implies, you
have to start the bug pattern detecion manually when the plug-in is in manual mode.

To enable manual mode:
1) Make sure that the [Run FindBugs automatically] checkbox on the Java project properties
   page is disabled.
2) Open the context menu of the current Java project.
3) Select [Find Bugs -> Find Bugs]. The bug pattern detection process will be started.
